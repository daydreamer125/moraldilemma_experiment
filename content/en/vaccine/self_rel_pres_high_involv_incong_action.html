<p> A viral epidemic has spread across the globe causing the death of many people. You are a medical researcher and have
    manufactured a substance in your laboratory, which could be used to develop a cure for the epidemic. Although your
    research has advanced well, you know that you will have to conduct tests investigating how the substance reacts when
    it comes into contact with a living human organism, in order to be able to finalize the antidote. At the current stage
    of development, however, this would also cause the death of the person, on which it is tested. Once you figure out how
    to finalize the substance, you will be able to create more of it and consequently prevent that multiple people will die.
</p>
<p> You come to the conclusion that you could forcibly inject some of the substance into the body of your lab assistant,
    who is working with you. This would enable you to conduct the final tests on the substance and manufacture an antidote.
    However, your lab assistant would die from getting in contact with the substance. If you do not inject the substance into
    your lab assistant, however, people will continue to die due to the epidemic. In order to avoid that people keep dying
    because of the epidemic, you would have to inject some of the substance into your lab assistant. You have already taken a
    syringe and approached your lab assistant from behind, in order to inject the substance into his body against his will.
    How would you behave in this situation?
</p>

<p><strong>Would you stop what you are doing, move away from your lab assistant, and dispose of the syringe again? </strong></p>
