<p> A viral epidemic has spread across the globe causing the death of many people. You are a medical researcher and have
    manufactured a substance in your laboratory, which could be used to develop a cure for the epidemic. Although your
    research has advanced well, you know that you will have to conduct tests investigating how the substance reacts when
    it comes into contact with a living human organism, in order to be able to finalize the antidote. At the current stage
    of development, however, this would also cause the death of the person, on which it is tested. Once you figure out how
    to finalize the substance, you will be able to create more of it and consequently prevent that multiple people will die.
</p>
<p> You come to the conclusion that you could pour some of the substance into the coffee cup of your lab assistant, who is
    working with you. This would enable you to conduct the final tests on the substance and manufacture an antidote.
    However, your lab assistant would die from getting in contact with the substance. If you do not pour the substance into
    the coffee cup of your lab assistant, however, people will continue to die due to the epidemic. In order to avoid that
    people keep dying because of the epidemic, you would have to pour some of the substance into the coffee cup of your lab assistant.
    You are currently at work in the laboratory and several meters away from your lab assistant, without having done anything of this
    sort. How would you behave in this situation?
</p>

<p><strong>Would you take a syringe, approach your lab assistantâ€˜s coffee cup, and
    unobtrusively pour the substance into it? </strong></p>
