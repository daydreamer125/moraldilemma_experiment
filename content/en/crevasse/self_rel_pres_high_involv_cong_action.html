<p> You and four other people are climbing a crevasse as a rope team. Suddenly the rope becomes wedged together across an ice ledge between the lead climber and you
    as the second climber of the rope team. This wedging makes it impossible for you and the three climbers behind you to continue climbing. The lead climber decides
    to secure the rope with an ice axe, to release himself, and to get help from the next rescue station. You know that this station is several miles off and that, before the
    rescue team arrives, you and the other three trapped climbers behind you will develop painful chilblains, which will last for some time. The lead climber has already released himself from the rope, being currently unsecured.</p>

<p> You come to the conclusion that you could tear at the leg of the lead climber, which would cause him to crash into the ice ledge. As a result, the ice ledge would break off, freeing you and the other three trapped climbers. The lead climber,
    however, would also die as a result of the crash. If you do not tear at the leg of the lead climber, though, you and the other three climbers will remain trapped and exposed to the cold. In order to avoid that you yourself and the other three trapped climbers
    suffer from painful chilblains for some time, you would have to tear at the leg of the lead climber. You have already set one hand free from the rope and grasped the leg of the lead
    climber, in order to tear at it. How would you behave in this situation? </p>

<p><strong>Would you abort your plan, let go of the leg of the lead climber, and clasp the rope with both hands again? </strong></p>
