<p>You work in an orphanage in a war-torn country. Rebel soldiers have staged a successful takeover of the government.
    The soldiers have entered your town and are dispossessing all those who did not support their regime, or whose loyalty is
    in question. You are furthermore aware that the soldiers want to kill everyone of a particular ethnic group in the
    country, as part of a goal-directed genocide. You have one child of this ethnic group in your orphanage. It will
    shortly be picked up by some relatives, whereby it
    would escape the soldiers. However, because contrary to the relatives and the soldiers the orphanage does not own a
    vehicle, there is no way for you and the other
    children and workers in the orphanage to escape. You know that the soldiers will dispossess everyone they find in the
    orphanage.</p>
<p>You reach the conclusion that you could smother the child, which belongs to the ethnic group focused on by the
    soldiers, with a pillow while it is sleeping, before its relatives arrive to pick it up. Since the soldiers hate the
    ethnic group it is a part of, they would see this as supporting their regime. This way you could make
    sure that the soldiers would spare you and the other children and workers instead of dispossessing you, although this
    would necessitate the death of the child. If you do not smother the child, though, the soldiers will dispossess you and
    the other workers and children in the orphanage. In order to avoid that you yourself and the other workers and
    children are dispossessed by the rebels, you would have to smother the child to death with a pillow. You have not yet
    attempted anything of this sort and are outside the room of the
    child. How would you behave in this situation?</p>

<p><strong>Would you get a pillow, enter the
    room of the child, and smother it with the pillow while it is sleeping? </strong></p>
