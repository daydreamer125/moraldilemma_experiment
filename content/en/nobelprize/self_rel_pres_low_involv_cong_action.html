<p> You and a fellow researcher are working in a small laboratory on the development of new technologies. You have recently developed
    a powerful energy converter, which you consider advanced and efficient. Irrespective of potential other areas of application
    for this converter, your colleague, who is in charge of the research project, has already decided to sell the converter to a
    local arms dealer and split the profit evenly between the two of you. You know that he plans to contact the buyer, who would use
    the energy converter for the manufacturing of a weapon, through which several people would be irreversibly injured, today.
    </p>
<p>You could release an odorless gas in the laboratory, which would explode, when your colleague turns on the gas burner.
    Because this gas is normally found in laboratories like yours, everybody would think that it was just a lab accident. You
    merely would have to turn open the container with the gas. This way you would ensure that the energy converter is not used as
    a weapon, though you would also cause the death of your colleague. If you do not release the flammable gas,
    however, he will sell the energy converter to the arms dealer, whereby several
    people will suffer injuries. In order to avoid that due to the sale of the converter to the arms
    dealer several people are irreversibly injured, you would have to release the flammable gas.
    You are currently alone in the laboratory, have already approached the container
    with the flammable gas and grabbed the valve, in order to release the gas in the
    laboratory. How would you behave in this situation?
    </p>

<p><strong>Would you abort your plan, let go of the valve, and distance yourself from the container again? </strong></p>
