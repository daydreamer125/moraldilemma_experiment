<p>You are a Peace Corps health-worker who is volunteering in a rural African village. A man from a nearby village has contracted a dangerous virus that is extremely
    contagious and incurable. It is known to you that, apart from causing other mild symptoms, the virus regularly leads to death within a week. Miraculously,
    though he is showing the mild symptoms, the man has been spared of death for a month, and so he must be a
    rare carrier who is immune to the deadly effects of the virus. However, he wrongly believes that your health center can
    cure his symptoms and approaches the village, without reacting to shouting or gesturing. Should he enter the
    village, he would pass the virus on to you and the other villagers so that, unlike him, all of you would die.</p>
<p> It comes to your mind that you could warn the village council, which would lead to one of the members shooting the man. This would stop him from entering the
    village. However, because due to the risk of infection nobody could treat his injuries, he would die from the bullet wound. If you do not warn the village
    council, however, he will pass the virus on to you and the rest of the village. In order to avoid that you yourself and the other villagers die
    from the virus, you would have to warn the village council before he enters the village. You have already entered
    the meeting place of village council and started talking to the members, in order to announce the information. How would you behave in
    this situation?  </p>

<p><strong>Would you abort your plan, end the conversation prematurely, and leave the meeting place again? </strong></p>
