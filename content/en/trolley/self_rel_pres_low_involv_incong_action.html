<p> A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks toward five people who it will collide with if it proceeds on its present
    course. Due to the size and weight of the trolley, this would cause the death of those five people. You are standing
    next to the track on which the trolley is travelling, but you are too far away from the people to warn them of the impending
    danger.
</p>
<p> Next to you there is a control switch for the tracks, which you could use to reroute the trolley onto another part of
    the track. This would stop the trolley from continuing on its current course. However, it would also mean the
    death of another man, who is on the track the trolley would be diverted on and who would be overrun as a result.
    If you do not flip the switch, though, the trolley will continue on its present course, resulting in the death of the
    five people. In order to avoid that the five people on the end of the track are hit and killed, you would have
    to flip the switch. You have already walked further towards the switch and extended your arms,
    in order to flip it. How would you behave in this situation?
</p>

<p><strong> Would you stop the action, take down your arms, and get away from the switch again? </strong></p>
