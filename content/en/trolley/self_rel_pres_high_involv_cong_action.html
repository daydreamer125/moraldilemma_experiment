<p> A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks toward five people who it will collide with if it proceeds on its present
    course. Due to the size and weight of the trolley, this would cause injuries to those five people. You are standing
    next to the track on which the trolley is travelling, but you are too far away from the people to warn them of the impending
    danger.
</p>
<p> Next to you there is a very heavy stranger minding his own business, who you could push onto the tracks in
    front of the trolley. This would stop the trolley from continuing on its current course. However, it would also mean the
    death of the heavy man. If you do not push the heavy man in front of the trolley, though, the trolley will continue on its
    present course, resulting in injuries for the five people. In order to avoid that the five people on the end of the
    track are hit and injured, you would have to push the heavy man in front of the trolley. You have already walked further
    towards the heavy man and extended your arms, in order to push him in front of the trolley. How would you behave in this
    situation?
</p>

<p><strong> Would you stop the action, take down your arms, and get away from the heavy man again? </strong></p>
