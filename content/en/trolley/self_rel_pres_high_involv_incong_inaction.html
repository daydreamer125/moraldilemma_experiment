<p> A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks toward five people who it will collide with if it proceeds on its present
    course. Due to the size and weight of the trolley, this would cause the death of those five people. You are standing
    next to the track on which the trolley is travelling, but you are too far away from the people to warn them of the impending
    danger.
</p>
<p> Next to you there is a very heavy stranger minding his own business, who you could push onto the tracks in
    front of the trolley. This would stop the trolley from continuing on its current course. However, it would also mean the
    death of the heavy man. If you do not push the heavy man in front of the trolley, though, the trolley will continue on its
    present course, resulting in the death of the five people. In order to avoid that the five people on the end of the
    track are hit and killed, you would have to push the heavy man in front of the trolley. You are currently standing close
    to the heavy man, without having walked further towards him. How would you behave in this situation?
</p>

<p><strong>Would you walk towards the heavy man, extend your arms, and push him in front of the trolley? </strong></p>
