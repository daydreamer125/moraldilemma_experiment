<p>You are a Peace Corps health-worker who is volunteering in a rural African village. A man from a nearby village has contracted a dangerous virus that is extremely
    contagious and incurable. It is known to you that, apart from causing other mild symptoms, the virus regularly leads to several days of weakness and extreme
    nausea within a week. Miraculously, though he is showing the mild symptoms, the man has been spared of weakness and nausea for a month, and
    so he must be a rare carrier who is immune to those effects of the virus. However, he wrongly believes that your health center can
    cure his symptoms and approaches the village, without reacting to shouting or gesturing. Should he enter the
    village, he would pass the virus on to you and the other villagers so that, unlike him, all of you would suffer several days of weakness and
    extreme nausea.</p>
<p> It comes to your mind that there is a loaded gun in the health center, which you could use to shoot him. This would stop him from entering the village. However,
    because due to the risk of infection nobody could treat his injuries, he would die from the bullet wound. If you do not shoot him, however, he will pass the virus on
    to you and the rest of the village. In order to avoid that you yourself and the other villagers suffer several days of weakness and
    extreme nausea from the virus, you would have to shoot the man before he enters the village.
    You have already gotten the gun and levelled it outside, in order to shoot the man. How would you behave in this situation? </p>

<p><strong>Would you abort your plan, take the gun down, and bring it back to the health center? </strong></p>
