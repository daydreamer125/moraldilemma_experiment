<p>You are the leader of a group of five soldiers in a country torn apart by civil war. Your group has become engaged in a firefight with hostile soldiers, in a mountainous
    area. Because their weaponry is superior to yours, you were pushed back and forced to take refuge in a cave. Your enemies decisively outnumber you and by now
    block the only exit, such that you know that there is no way for you to escape. Suddenly the leader of the other group makes you an offer. Your entire group would be
    allowed to retreat unharmed, under the condition that you would kill one of your enemies’ prisoners by shooting him from a distance. Otherwise, they will use their heavy weaponry to bring down the only exit, before leaving you behind locked in the cave.</p>

<p> You know that the leader of the other group is bound to his word as a soldier, and that he will hold up his end of the deal, as well as accept whatever decision you make. By taking up the offer and shooting the prisoner from a distance,
    you would make sure that you and your group would be able to retreat. However, this would also mean the death of the prisoner. If you do not
    shoot him from a distance, though, your enemies’ heavy weaponry will bring down the exit to the cave. Because you are low on supplies and the cave is located in a remote part of the country,
    this would cause you yourself and the entire group to starve to death before you will manage to dig your way out of the cave and make it back to your camp. In order to avoid that you yourself and the other soldiers
    starve to death, you would have to shoot the prisoner from a distance. You have already agreed to the offer and walked outside the cave, in order to cut
    the prisoner’s throat with a knife. How would you behave in this situation? </p>

<p><strong> Would you stop, walk back into the cave, and withdraw your agreement to the offer? </strong></p>
