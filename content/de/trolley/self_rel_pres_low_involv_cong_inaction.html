<p> A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks toward five people who it will collide with if it proceeds on its present
    course. Due to the size and weight of the trolley, this would cause injuries to those five people. You are standing
    next to the track on which the trolley is travelling, but you are too far away from the people to warn them of the impending
    danger.
</p>
<p> Next to you there is a control switch for the tracks, which you could use to reroute the trolley onto another part of
    the track. This would stop the trolley from continuing on its current course. However, it would also mean the
    death of another man, who is on the track the trolley would be diverted on and who would be overrun as a result.
    If you do not flip the switch, though, the trolley will continue on its present course, resulting in injuries for the
    five people. In order to avoid that the five people on the end of the track are injured, you would have
    to flip the switch. You are currently standing close to the switch, without having walked further
    towards it. How would you behave in this situation?
</p>

<p><strong> Would you walk towards the switch, extend your arms, and flip it? </strong></p>
