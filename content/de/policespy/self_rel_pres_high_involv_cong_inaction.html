<p> You are a police spy investigating a radical underground organization. This underground organization fights against
    a group of activists that they consider their enemies. To you it is well known that the underground organization is
    planning an assault on the activist group. Since the underground organization is highly prone to violence, the assault
    will injure several members of the activist group. At the current stage, you are lacking precise information about the
    upcoming assault and are therefore unable to prevent it. You just know that it is going to happen in a couple of days.
    You decide to join the underground organization as an undercover investigator, in order to get access to a storage
    medium with internal information about the planned assault. Since the leader of the underground organization is
    sceptical towards new members, he demands a sign of loyalty.
</p>
<p> You could accept his demand, which consists in strangling one of the activists. This activist is about to leave the
    country for some weeks and would therefore not be affected by the assault. This would persuade the leader of the underground
    organization of your loyalty, enabling you to get access to the storage medium. However, it would also mean the death
    of the activist that is about to leave the country. If you do not strangle the activist, though, the assault on the
    activist group will be executed as planned. In order to avoid that several members of the activist group are
    injured in the assault, you would have to strangle the activist that is about to leave the country. You are currently
    observing the activist, who has not noticed you, from inside your car. How would you behave in this situation?
</p>

<p><strong> Would you wait for an unobserved moment, approach the activist, and strangle him? </strong></p>
