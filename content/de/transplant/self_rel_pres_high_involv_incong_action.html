<p>You are a doctor in a hospital. You have five patients, each of whom is about to die due to a failing organ,
    unless they have donor organs implanted within a very short period of time. A new patient is rushed into the hospital
    after a serious car accident. This patient is severely wounded and in need of immediate surgery. While performing a long and
    complicated surgery on the victim of the accident you realize that you could inconspicuously cut through one of his arteries,
    without anyone ever being able to prove that you did anything on purpose. Hereby you would
    receive organ donations for the other five patients, the victim of the accident would die, though.

</p>
<p> If you do not cause the death of the accident victim and then transplant his organs, however, the other five patients will die.
    In order to avoid that the other five patients die due to failing organs you would have to cut through one of the arteries of the
    accident victim, so that you could transplant his organs after his death. You are currently performing the surgical operation, have already deviated from
    the prescribed procedure and have led your scalpel to one of the big arteries of the accident victim, in order to cut it
    inconspicuously. How would you behave in this situation?  </p>

<p><strong> Would you abort your plan, remove your scalpel from the artery, and return to the prescribed procedure? </strong></p>
