<p> You and a fellow researcher are working in a small laboratory on the development of new technologies. You have recently developed
    a powerful energy converter, which you consider advanced and efficient. Irrespective of potential other areas of application
    for this converter, your colleague, who is in charge of the research project, has already decided to sell the converter to a
    local arms dealer and split the profit evenly between the two of you. You know that he plans to contact the buyer, who would use
    the energy converter for the manufacturing of a weapon, through which several people would be irreversibly injured, today.
    </p>
<p>You could poison him by bringing him in contact with a chemical, you are in possession of, and which leads to immediate death in the case of direct skin
    contact. Because this chemical is normally found in laboratories like yours, everybody would think that it was just a lab accident. You merely would have to
    trickle a drop of the chemical on his skin in an unobserved moment. This way you would ensure that the energy converter is not used as a weapon, though you would
    also cause the death of your colleague. If you do not poison your colleague, however, he will sell the energy converter to the
    arms dealer, whereby several people will suffer injuries. In order to avoid that due to the sale of the converter to the arms
    dealer several people are irreversibly injured, you would have to poison your colleague. You have not undertaken anything yet and are currently in the laboratory close to
    the container with the deadly chemical. How would you behave in this situation?
    </p>

<p><strong>Would you put on protective gloves, inconspicuously approach your colleague
    with a small amount of the chemical, and trickle a drop of it on his skin? </strong></p>
